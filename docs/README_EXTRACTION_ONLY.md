# Invoice Extraction AI - Extraction Only Mode

This version of the Invoice Extraction AI focuses purely on extracting and displaying invoice data without any storage functionality.

## Features

- Extract invoice data from PDF files
- Support for multi-page PDFs
- Automatic language detection and translation
- Image preprocessing for better OCR results
- Detailed console output with formatted display

## Removed Features

- Excel file storage
- Database functionality
- Duplicate checking
- Data persistence

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

This will process the PDF file specified in `main.py` (default: "ali.pdf") and print the extracted data to the console.

### Command Line Example

```bash
python extract_only_example.py invoice.pdf
```

### Without Preprocessing

```bash
python extract_only_example.py invoice.pdf --no-preprocess
```

## Output Format

The extraction results are displayed in a structured format:

```
